        <p>Studying the letters within the archives, a set of information have been carefully collected and some data has been produced, data that comprehend details such as date, sender, recipient, destination, origin, etc.</p>
        <p>Those informations are the remarkable result of the meticulous reasearch work done by a number of different scholars, where the close observation of details produces interpretations that are often too accurate and too particular to be succesfully converted into a form that is easy to store and compute - and then visualisated.</p>
        <p>This is the reason why those datasets contain variances and inconsistences; they are to be carefully managed and are not (always) to be intended as “errors” since they could give the opportunity to see intriguing new aspect on the matter (of correspondence).</p>
        <p>This way of approaching the analysis and visualisation of data is a very uncommon one, especially if we consider the fact that has often to do with things such as standardization, automation and computation.</p>

        <p>The map above represents the extent of a portion of the Republic of Letters as if the letters would have travelled nowadays.</p>
        <p>Of course, the original routes of the letters were totally different, but we do not have any way of visualising them with today’s resources and technologies.</p>
        <p>Moreover, this example of visualisation could be seen as a very misleading one. The reason it that it assumes that the standard way of linking these places involved is overland transportation; but this is not the case.  The standard route for a letter from London to Stockholm, for instance, would not be to take the channel tunnel from Dover to Calais and then the road bridges from Germany via Denmark to Sweden: it would travel by down the Thames, up the North Sea, through the Danish Sound, and up the Baltic to Stockholm. In fact, a letter from Transylvania would typically come via Upper Hungary (Slovakia), down the Vistula to Danzig / Gdansk, and likewise via the Baltic and North Sea to London.</p>
        <p>So mapping transportation via modern road networks is not sufficient. Compared with another kind of transportation, like the modern air routes, it could be seen, in some ways, even more misleading, precisely since no one could imaging that the latter represent the actual route taken by the letter.</p>
        <p>Both of the cases are misleding for some reason, but it is good to experiment in order to understand what you gain and what you loose in every different attempt.</p>
